## How to read and understand the codes in github.

- Click on the ,,commits" on the right upper side below the green button ,,Code" . 
  Then you see all the commits that has been made in the repository.  The commit has four columns.  
- Read the description or comment in the oldest row and first column  and remember the commit comment. 
- Click on the last column where  ,,<>" this symbol is given. 
- You will come to the repository which is updated till the commit has been excecuted. 
- Now you look only those files which match with the current commit . i.e. with the commit that is given the row you previoulsy read. 
- Understand the changes that are made there. 

- Next you look for the  newer commit and read the code in the similar manner. 
  In this way, you can come up to all the commits and codes till the newest one.
